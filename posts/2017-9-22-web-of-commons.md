# The Web of Commons

I gave a Keynote talk at [Full Stack Fest](https://fullstackfest.com) this month in Barcelona. It was my first time speaking to such a large group of developers as the Keynote speaker of the day -- the first one of the week, too!

This time, I spoke about a concept I like to call the 'Web of Commons' -- a way to apply common pool resource management to web-based applications. In this talk I particularly focused in on our application of these techniques to scientific data management. This way of managing resources (data, in this case) could also be applied to social networks, creative commons, open source code, libraries, wikis, and other kinds of free knowledge-based resources.
