After almost four years of working hard on developing, documenting, grant
writing, hiring, partnering, and project managing, I'm going to move on from
the Dat Project. It's always bittersweet to leave a project behind, but
I am excited to have the opportunity to continue staying in touch by being
a board member of Dat's parent non-profit, Code for Science & Society. I will
continue advising the project with a talented bunch
of folks: Kaitlin Thaney, Kristen Ratan, Waldo Jaquith, and Joshua M.
Greenberg. [Feel free to
read the full announcement of the new board](https://blog.datproject.org/2018/02/13/css-board/). I'm proud to see how the team at
Dat has flourished in the past year, and excited for the future! 

Now that I'm on the board, I will no longer be an employee of CSS. So, this month I start working with [Digital Democracy](http://digital-democracy) on
their mapping tools: Mapeo, Mapfilter, and Geotrove. They are an amazing group of folks that empower marginalized
communities to use technology to defend their rights. We have partners
primarily in South America, and this means I get to make some trips to the
Amazon rainforest this year to watch my code in action. In this time of
environmental crisis, I feel an immense duty to do what I can to help
marginalized people maintain and defend their ancestral lands from the
encroachment of brutal capitalist multi-national corporations and negligent
governments.
