One of the most impactful cultural lies today tells us that technology operates
independently from humans. This lie tells us to objectify the Internet as
a series of tubes, as brightly colored lines that fire in rapid succession
against the backdrop of space.  Newsrooms show zeroes and ones while engineers sit and attempt to
decipher cryptic codes sprawling across dark screens. Artificial Intelligence
is portrayed as a robot -- self-sovereign, created by a team of (largely) men
but now independently acting without human intervention. The ethos of
technology then is portrayed as autonomous, and largely seems to have "a mind
of it's own." 

This portrayal of technology leaves us helpless to change the rules of the
game. The code is then the law that runs shapes freedom of expression,
economics, and politics. Some people go as far to proclaim and act as though
their code is so separate from the law that they entirely ignore laws (see Uber,
AirBnb, Amazon). 

It's clear that technological solutions on their own are <i>not enough</i>
to move the Web in an ethical direction. Those who depend upon the
corporate controled technical infrastructure & closed-source cloud software
should be worried. Everyone who uses the internet to mobilize social change
efforts are impacted. We need to work together to leverage policy, advocacy, and organizing to solve the largest challenges on a limited budget.

To this end, I enrolled and completed <a
href="https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/">Aspen Institute's Tech Policy
Hub</a>. Together with Anil Dewan (USDS) and Allison Day (Google), I researched
& published a report on data-driven reform in criminal justice. We wrote an
operational plan and guide for information and technology officials at the
state level. We offer a set of recommendations which will greatly improve
results for the next year within a limited budget -- the Judicial Council has
already allocated $7.5 million for these improvements in 2020. We give them the
means to execute, by utilizing modular toolsets & open source and hiring
internally, rather than chasing large and ineffective procurement contracts.

California counties have limited technical resources for improving pretrial
data systems, yet they increasingly rely on algorithmic risk assessment tools
to inform pretrial release decisions. At stake is the liberty of individuals
not yet convicted of crimes, and the reduction of the massive pretrial jail
population, a main driver of mass incarceration.
