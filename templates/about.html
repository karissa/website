    <b>Karissa McKelvey</b> is a <a href="http://github.com/karissa">software
      engineer</a> by training, but now she spends most of her day consulting
    with open source engineers and project leaders, helping them achieve their
    goals. She is an expert on cooperative and sustainable practices in open
    source, particularly within a digital rights framework that encompasses
    universal access, security, privacy, inclusion, and equity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    As the <a href="https://dat.foundation">Director of the Dat
    Foundation</a>, she works with diverse sets of stakeholders, from
    environmentalists to blockchain companies, who operate under the assumption
    that industry left alone will not act in the public interest. In 2016, she
    co-founded Code for Science and Society to systematize this work across the
    ecosystem of open source public interest technology.</p>

    <p> 
    It's clear that technology on its own is <i>not enough</i> to move
    technology in an ethical direction. To this end, she is currently a fellow
    at the <a href="https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/">Aspen Institute's Tech
    Policy Hub</a>, where she is growing her skills to advocate for
    policies in the interest of digital human rights around the globe.
