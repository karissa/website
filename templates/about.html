    Karissa McKelvey is a <a href="http://github.com/karissa">software
      engineer</a> by training, but now she spends most of her day talking to open
    source stakeholders and bringing them together. As the <a href="https://dat.foundation">Director of the Dat
    Foundation</a>, she works with diverse sets of engineers and product
  leaders, from environmentalists all the way to blockchain companies, who have
  realized that somewhere along the way, the web lost its bearings. She helps
  them succeed in their goals to respect the digital rights of their users.

    In 2016, she cofounded Code for Science and Society to systematize this
    work across the open source ecosystem of public interest technology. This
    community leads with ethics: human rights, universal access, security,
    privacy, and inclusion. These projects hinge on the fact that industry left
    alone will not meet the needs of the public interest.

    She realizes technology is never enough on its own to move the web in the
    right direction. To this end, she is currently a fellow at the <a
    href="https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/">Aspen Institute's Tech Policy
    Hub</a>, where she is growing her skills to advocatie for digital human
  rights around the globe. 

  <a

    a data scientist,</a> her work studying online political communication
  resulted in multiple peer-reviewed papers and press in outlets such as NPR
  and the Wall Street Journal.
